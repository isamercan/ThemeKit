# Changelog — @isamercan/themekit-mcp

All notable changes to the **ThemeKit MCP server** are documented here. This is the
npm package under [`mcp/`](.); the ThemeKit Swift library has its own
[CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md). The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.4.1] - 2026-06-30

Fixes stale catalog data after the library's modifier-based refactor.

### Fixed
- **Regenerated `data/themekit.json`** from the post-refactor symbol graph (117
  components, 164 modifiers). The previous data still described the old
  initializer-heavy APIs (e.g. `ThemeButton(color:variant:size:…)`,
  `Badge(style:…)`) that the refactor removed — the MCP would have generated code
  against deleted initializers.
- **Figma codegen no longer emits a removed `style:` init arg.** A new mapping
  option `styleModifier` (e.g. `"badgeStyle"`) routes the style axis to the
  chainable modifier (`Badge("Sale").badgeStyle(.error)`), matching the refactored
  API; the old `style:` init path is kept only when the component still declares it.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-06-30

Accessibility moves to the design source: `figma_to_swiftui` now runs a WCAG 2.1
audit on the Figma node tree itself — using the design's real colors, font sizes and
dimensions, before any code is generated.

### Added
- **Figma-layer accessibility audit** (`src/figma/a11yAudit.ts`) — walks the node
  tree carrying the nearest opaque surface as background context and grades:
  - **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)** — text fill vs. the resolved surface, with the
    large-text threshold (≥18pt, or ≥14pt bold → 3:1; else 4.5:1).
  - **1.4.4 / legibility** — font sizes below an 11pt floor.
  - **2.5.5 Target Size** — interactive nodes smaller than 44×44pt (via
    `absoluteBoundingBox`).
  - **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value** — interactive elements with no visible text.
  - **1.1.1 Non-text Content** — icons/images with no text alternative.
- **`figma_to_swiftui(…, a11yOnly: true)`** — returns just the accessibility audit
  (no code, no mapping). The audit is also appended to the normal mapping report.

### Changed
- `FigmaNode` gained `absoluteBoundingBox`, `opacity` and `visible`; the mapping
  `Report` gained an `a11y: A11yFinding[]` field, surfaced by `formatReport`.

### Internal
- New fixture `test/fixtures/figma-a11y.json` and 6 audit tests (25 total).

## [2.3.0] - 2026-06-30

A correctness + accessibility release: three new tools, a modifier/state-aware
Figma codegen path, and a config-driven migration layer. The catalog/token data is
still built from the single source of truth (DocC symbol graph + theme JSON), so APIs
can't drift.

### Added
- **`diff_theme(a, b)`** — compares two theme presets channel by channel (primary /
  secondary / accent / base) with the per-channel **CIE76 ΔE** and a same/close/different
  verdict.
- **`compose_screen(components, title?, layout?, spacing?)`** — builds a token-bound
  SwiftUI screen from an **ordered, catalog-verified** component list (unknown names are
  flagged, never silently dropped); `vstack` / `scroll` / `card` layouts.
- **`a11y_audit(swift)`** — accessibility audit: interactive controls missing
  `.a11yID(_:)`, images/icons without an accessibility label, hardcoded colors, plus a
  WCAG contrast hint between detected hex pairs.
- **`get_design_tokens(category: "contrast")`** — a WCAG 2.1 text-on-surface contrast
  report (AA / AA-Large / AAA grading) across the key surfaces.

### Changed
- **`figma_to_swiftui` is now modifier/state-aware** — variant properties and node
  names map to chainable modifiers: `State=Disabled` → `.disabled(true)`,
  `Size=Large` → `.controlSize(.large)`; selected/active states are flagged for a
  `Binding` rather than invented. Mapping rules (`figma-mapping.json`) gained an
  optional `modifiers` array (`emit` + `whenName` / `whenProp`).
- **Unmapped/raw `Text` now snaps its fill to a theme token color** via the token
  accessor instead of being emitted bare.
- **`validate_code` is stronger** — anti-pattern checks are now string/comment-aware
  (no false positives from literals or comments), it detects **unknown / hallucinated
  components** against the real catalog (with a "did you mean" suggestion), and it
  checks multi-line **brace / paren / bracket balance**.
- **`migrate_snippet` is config-driven** — rewrite rules now live in
  [`migrate-rules.json`](./migrate-rules.json) (regex `find` / `replace` / `note`)
  instead of being hardcoded; edit/extend without touching the server.
- The server **version is read from `package.json`** (single source of truth) instead
  of a hardcoded string.

### Fixed
- Removed dead code in `tokenAccessor` (an unused variable and two no-op `replace`s).

### Internal
- New `node:test` suites for WCAG contrast helpers, the modifier-aware Figma codegen
  (new `figma-states.json` fixture), and the config-driven migrate / mapping rules
  (19 tests total).
- **CI now builds & tests the MCP** on every push/PR — a dedicated Linux Node/TS job
  in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `npm ci && npm test`.

## [2.2.0]

- Prior published baseline: 20 tools (read context, generation, themes), Figma →
  SwiftUI codegen with token snapping, and the DocC-symbol-graph data pipeline.
